#Application name: Image Effects

	So far what my app do is that it opens up to the starting screen with a “open camera” button. The first time the user would press the button the program would stop and would call a camera permission exception. Saying that the program tries to access the camera but does not have the permission to access the camera. I have spent hours on this and have found only one solution that would fix this problem on my code. Which is after trying to run the app once and having it crash. The user would have to go to the phone setting, go to the app section, find the “Image Effects” app, and turn the camera access from no to yes….Yea….Once the user does this, the app should be able to access the camera no problem. For some reason sometime the app will lag a lot to open the camera. Sometime the user would be able to take a picture and then would have the app lag on them when moving back to app to see the image. This is as far as I got with this app. I do have the code for the rest of the functionality of the app, but due to the lag would ever get to the point in testing the rest of the code. What would happen after the image is taken is that the 8 hidden buttons that each have a effect for the image would be visible. AND HOPEFULLY that each of the function of the buttons would work how I coded it. The purpose of the app is to give the users the ability to take any picture them want and would be able to put any of the 8 image effects on it.
